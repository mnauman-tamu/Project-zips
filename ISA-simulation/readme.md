This is a simulation of an ISA. For the final project of my Computer Organization class, my teammate and I built a simplified ISA based upon the y86 syntax. This project takes in code in Y86 syntax, transforms it into hex code using Python, and executes it in a CPU built in Logisim. This project helped me understand how a CPU actually works, which is essential knowledge for a programmer.
